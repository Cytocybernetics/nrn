Welcome to CoreBluron!

CoreBluron is a neuroscience simulation software based on the popular software NEURON (www.neuron.yale.edu). 
Its goal is to simulate massive cell networks with minimal memory footprint and optimal performance. 

Please follow these instructions in order to build and run the code. 


TO BUILD:
--------

CoreBluron is using MPI for parallelization. Currently the following compilers/MPI libraries for production
simulations are used:
- Blue Gene/Q: XLC 12.1.0.7
- x86_64: icc 13.1, mvapich 2.0

You can use other compilers and MPI library distributions. Make sure that appropriate modules are loaded and
CMake (minimum required version 2.8) is correctly setting appropriate compilers/libraries. In order to build
the simulator follow the steps below:

1. Set the correct MPI compilers (wrappers) with the CC and CXX environment flags. 
   Example: on a Blue Gene Q:
     export CC=mpixlc
     export CXX=mpixlcxx

2. To build the binaries and libraries use the CMake build system (from the top level folder of CoreBluron)
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make
