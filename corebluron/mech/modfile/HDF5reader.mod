COMMENT
This is intended to serve two purposes.  One as a general purpose reader for HDF5 files with a basic set of
accessor functions.  In addition, it will have special handling for our synapse data files such that they can be handled
more efficiently in a  massively parallel manner.  I feel inclined to spin this functionality out into a c++ class where
I can access more advanced coding structures, especially STL.
